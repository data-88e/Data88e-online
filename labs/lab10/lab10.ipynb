In addition, the account compounds interest from last year's balance, with constant interest rate `r`. **`r` is expressed as a proportion.** So if an account yields 10% interest, `r = 0.1`. `t` is how many years this account accrues interest. In this example, if `t` is 0, the balance in the account is just the deposit as no interest has been accrued. If `t` is 1, the balance in the account is the initial deposit with interest compounded, plus the next year's deposit."
